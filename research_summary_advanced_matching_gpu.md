# --- Phase 3: Feasibility Analysis ---

feasibility_analysis = """
**Feasibility Analysis:**

**Advanced String Matching Algorithms:**

*   **Levenshtein & Damerau-Levenshtein:** Highly feasible. Already have Python implementations (e.g., `python-Levenshtein`, `jellyfish`). Relatively simple to integrate and understand. Good for basic typo tolerance.
    *   *Challenges:* Computational cost for very large pairwise comparisons if not optimized (e.g., through blocking). Standard versions treat all characters equally, which might not be ideal for all name variations.
*   **Smith-Waterman & Needleman-Wunsch:** Less directly applicable for standard full name matching due to their focus on local and global sequence alignment, respectively, often with bioinformatics-specific scoring. Could be adapted for specific use cases (e.g., finding common substrings) but adds complexity.
    *   *Challenges:* Adapting scoring for names, potentially higher computational cost than simpler edit distances for the same task.
*   **N-gram Based Similarity (with TF-IDF):** Feasible. Scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer` with character n-grams is a straightforward way to implement this.
    *   *Challenges:* Choosing the right 'N' and potentially large feature space if not managed (e.g., with `HashingVectorizer`).
*   **Monge-Elkan:** Feasible. Libraries like `py_stringmatching` provide implementations. Good for structured names with multiple tokens.
    *   *Challenges:* Tokenization quality is crucial. Performance depends on the chosen secondary similarity metric.
*   **Phonetic Algorithms (Metaphone, Double Metaphone):** Feasible using existing libraries (`jellyfish`, `Metaphone`).
    *   *Challenges:* Primarily English-centric, may not be optimal for Filipino names without specific adaptations or a Filipino-specific phonetic algorithm (which was not readily found).
*   **Machine Learning (Siamese Networks, Triplet Loss):** Feasible but significantly more complex. Requires substantial labeled training data, expertise in ML/DL, and more computational resources for training.
    *   *Challenges:* Data acquisition and labeling, model training and tuning complexity, "black box" nature. However, offers the potential for higher accuracy and handling nuanced similarities.

**GPU Acceleration Libraries:**

*   **RAPIDS (cuDF/nvtext):**
    *   *Feasibility:* High for batch processing of large datasets (if data fits GPU memory) using Pandas-like syntax. `nvtext` can accelerate feature engineering.
    *   *Challenges:* Data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU. Learning curve for GPU-specific memory management if going beyond basic cuDF. Direct acceleration of arbitrary Python string functions might require integration with Numba/CuPy.
*   **Numba:**
    *   *Feasibility:* High for accelerating CPU-bound Python functions with decorators. For GPU, writing custom CUDA kernels in Python with `@cuda.jit` is feasible for specific, performance-critical parts of algorithms (e.g., parallelizing pairwise distance calculations).
    *   *Challenges:* CUDA programming concepts needed for GPU kernels. Not all Python code/features are Numba-compatible in `nopython` mode.
*   **CuPy:**
    *   *Feasibility:* High for NumPy-like operations on numerical data derived from names (e.g., embeddings, feature vectors). Custom CUDA C++ kernels can be integrated for highly specialized string operations on GPU.
    *   *Challenges:* Requires data in CuPy arrays. Writing custom C++ CUDA kernels is advanced. Less direct support for string objects compared to cuDF.
*   **PyTorch / TensorFlow:**
    *   *Feasibility:* Essential if pursuing ML approaches like Siamese networks for training and inference on GPUs.
    *   *Challenges:* Steeper learning curve for ML model development. Primarily for tensor computations, not direct string operations (strings need vectorization first).

**Overall Feasibility & Integration:**

*   **Short-term:** Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, N-grams (with TF-IDF), and Monge-Elkan are readily implementable and can offer improvements over the current Jaro-Winkler/Soundex baseline. They can be integrated into the existing Python workflow.
*   **Medium-term:** Exploring ML approaches like Siamese Networks (with PyTorch/TensorFlow) offers the highest potential for accuracy but requires significant development effort, data, and GPU resources for training.
*   **GPU Acceleration:**
    *   **RAPIDS/cuDF:** Best for large-scale data preprocessing and feature engineering on tabular name data.
    *   **Numba/CuPy:** Useful for accelerating specific, computationally intensive parts of custom matching algorithms, especially if they can be expressed as numerical operations or custom CUDA kernels. Pairwise distance calculations for edit-based distances are a good candidate if batch sizes are large.
    *   The choice depends on where the bottlenecks are. If data loading and preprocessing are slow for large datasets, cuDF is promising. If the matching algorithm itself is the bottleneck for many pairs, Numba/CuPy for custom kernels or ML models on PyTorch/TensorFlow could be beneficial.
    *   A hybrid approach is possible: e.g., use cuDF for initial data handling, then Numba/CuPy for custom distance calculations on extracted numerical features, or PyTorch/TensorFlow for ML model inference.
*   **Filipino Names:** The lack of readily available, specialized phonetic algorithms for Filipino names means that either existing phonetic algorithms must be used with caution, custom linguistic rules developed, or ML models trained specifically on Filipino name data to capture local nuances effectively. N-gram and Monge-Elkan methods might offer better out-of-the-box adaptability for structural variations common in Filipino names than purely phonetic English-based methods.

**Potential Challenges:**
*   **Data for ML:** Acquiring and labeling a large, high-quality dataset of Filipino name pairs/triplets for training ML models.
*   **Complexity:** Implementing and tuning advanced ML models or GPU-accelerated custom kernels is more complex than using off-the-shelf string metrics.
*   **GPU Memory/Overhead:** For GPU solutions, managing data transfer between CPU and GPU memory can be an overhead if not handled efficiently. Large datasets might not fit entirely in GPU memory, requiring batching strategies.
*   **Development Time:** Integrating new algorithms or GPU libraries will require development and testing time.
